# Ai-Disease-predictor
# 🧠 AI Disease Predictor

An intelligent disease prediction system built using machine learning techniques to assist in early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes. This project leverages data-driven insights to classify and predict diseases based on patient symptoms and medical parameters.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook, developed in Google Colab, demonstrates a complete pipeline for disease prediction:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction and visualization

The goal is to create a scalable and interpretable model that can support medical professionals in decision-making.
